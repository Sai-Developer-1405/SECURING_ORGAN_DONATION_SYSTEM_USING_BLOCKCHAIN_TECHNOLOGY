# Securing Organ Donation System Using Blockchain Technology

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Securing Organ Donation System Using Blockchain Technology** project is a decentralized application that ensures a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof organ donation process. By leveraging **blockchain technology**, this system enhances **trust, security, and immutability** in managing donor and recipient records, ensuring the integrity of the organ transplantation process.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Decentralized System** – Eliminates central authority, providing transparency and security.
- **Smart Contracts** – Automates the organ donation and matching process securely.
- **Data Integrity** – Ensures donor and recipient records are immutable.
- **Enhanced Security** – Prevents unauthorized tampering and fraud.
- **Real-time Verification** – Enables real-time validation of organ donors and recipients.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Solidity, Smart Contracts
- **Database:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage
- **Tools & Libraries:** Web3.js, Truffle, Ganache

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites:
- Install **Node.js** and **npm**
- Install **Truffle** and **Ganache** for local blockchain development
- Install **Metamask** browser extension for Ethereum transactions

### Steps to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sai-Developer-1405/SECURING_ORGAN_DONATION_SYSTEM_USING_BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SECURING_ORGAN_DONATION_SYSTEM_USING_BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the Ganache blockchain:
